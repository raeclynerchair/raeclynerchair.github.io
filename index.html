				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>Gâ€™day. 
<p>Welcome, dear travellers, to the land Down Under! Where the sun is hot, the wildlife is deadly, and the locals speak a language that's halfway between English and "what did they just say?!"</p>

<p>I'm your guide, Rae, an English lad who's been thrown headfirst into the shocking wonderland of Australia and lived to tell the tale.</p>

<p>Now, before we dive into this adventure, let me give you a bit of advice: forget everything you think you know about navigating a foreign land. Australia isn't your average place. Here, the rules are as wild and unpredictable as the creatures lurking in the bushes.
Welcome to Australia, where the adventure never ends, and the phrase "No worries" is more than just a catchphrase; it's a way of life. So grab your cork hat and your sense of humour, because you're in for one <b>bloody ripper of a time!</b></p>
