				<h2>Local slang/behaviour</h2>
				<p>Now, onto the locals. Australians are a peculiar breed. They'll greet you with a friendly "G'day mate!" and then proceed to call you a "bloody *drongo" if you do something they don't fancy. 
It's all part of their charm, I suppose. But don't let their casual demeanour fool you, these folks take their sports, especially cricket and footy, more seriously then the King takes his afternoon tea. So, if you find yourself in a pub during game day, tread lightly and choose your team wisely. Otherwise, you might end up on the receiving end of a *dog’s eye to the face.</p>
				
	<p>*The word "drongo" is used in Australian English as a mild form of insult meaning "idiot" This originates from an Australian racehorse with the same name (named after the spangled drongo, D. bracteatus) in the 1920s that never won despite MANY places. Bloody drongo.</p>

				<p>*Dog’s eye, disturbingly, is slang for a meat pie.</p> 
				<p> <strong>Most slang can be heard across the outback. Stay wary, it can be confusing!: </strong>
					<strong>Arvo</strong> - Afternoon
<strong>Bogan</strong> - An unsophisticated person, often associated with working-class culture.
<strong>Fair dinkum</strong> - Genuine or real; often used to emphasize truth.
<strong>G’day</strong> - Hello; a friendly greeting.
<strong>Mate</strong> - Friend; a term of endearment or camaraderie.
<strong>Barbie</strong> - Barbecue; often used to refer to a cookout.
<strong>Chockers</strong> - Full or packed, often used to describe a crowded place.
<strong>Deadset</strong> - Absolutely; used to affirm something strongly.
<strong>Lollies</strong> - Candy or sweets.
<strong>No worries</strong> - It’s all good; used to indicate that something is fine or not a problem.

				<h2>FLAT WOITE AWARENESS!</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>In Australia, one of the most commonly heard phrases can be "Flat White, most usually pronounced "Flat Whoite.</li>
					<li>There is unfortunately a growing pandemic of tourists coming to Australia, specifically Melbourne, that are heavily embarassing themselves by trying to replicate the pronounciation. This is, quite frankly for your own comfort, a terrible idea. As a tourist, Aussies will NOT think you're the new hip Australian in town! Say it how you normally do, otherwise it is painstakingly obvious, and you <strong>may</strong> end up with a dog's eye to the face.</li>
					<li><strong>Stay aware!</strong></li>
